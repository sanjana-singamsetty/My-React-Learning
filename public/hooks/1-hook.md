### âœ… **Core React Hooks (Functional Components)**

Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.
Here are some of the most commonly used core React hooks:

- **`useState`**: Adds local state to functional components.
- **`useEffect`**: Runs side effects after render (like API calls, subscriptions).
- **`useContext`**: Accesses value from a React context provider.
- **`useRef`**: Holds a mutable reference that persists across renders.
- **`useMemo`**: Memoizes a computed value to optimize performance.
- **`useCallback`**: Memoizes a callback function to avoid re-creation.
- **`useReducer`**: Manages complex local state with a reducer pattern (like Redux).
- **`useLayoutEffect`**: Runs synchronously after render but before painting the screen.
- **`useImperativeHandle`**: Customizes what a ref exposes to the parent.
- **`useDebugValue`**: Helps show custom hook values in React DevTools.
- **`useId`**: Generates unique IDs for accessibility and hydration.
- **`useTransition`**: Marks state updates as non-blocking transitions (for smoother UX).
- **`useDeferredValue`**: Defers re-rendering a value until browser is idle (improves performance).
- **`useSyncExternalStore`**: Used to subscribe to external stores (like Redux).
- **`useInsertionEffect`**: For injecting styles before DOM mutations (rare, advanced).

### ðŸ§  Bonus: **Custom Hooks**

Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
Hooks cannot be conditional
