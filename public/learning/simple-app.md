That's a great idea — combining all major React hooks in a small project will help you **deeply understand** when and why each hook is used.

## 🧩 🔧 Suggested Mini Project: **"Smart Todo App"**

You’ll build a simple **Todo App** that includes:

- Adding and deleting tasks
- Showing completed tasks
- Counting tasks
- Persisting data (optional)
- Animating layout (optional)
- Sharing state across components

---

## 🎯 Hooks You'll Use and Why:

You’ll use a variety of React hooks to manage state, side effects, references, and shared data in your Todo App. For example:

- **`useState`**: Store todos and input values.
- **`useEffect`**: Load and save todos from localStorage.
- **`useRef`**: Focus the input or reference DOM elements.
- **`useCallback`**: Memoize handlers like add or delete.
- **`useMemo`**: Memoize derived values such as the completed task count.
- **`useReducer`**: Manage todos with actions like add, delete, and toggle.
- **`useContext`**: Share theme or data across components.
- **`useLayoutEffect`** (optional): Measure DOM or scroll position.

Each hook helps you solve a specific problem in the app, making your code more organized and efficient.

---

## 🧪 Example Feature Plan:

### ✅ 1. Add Task

Use `useState` or `useReducer` to track task list.

### ✅ 2. Delete/Toggle Task

Use `useReducer` for cleaner logic.

### ✅ 3. Show Completed Count

Use `useMemo` to calculate count.

### ✅ 4. Focus Input on Mount

Use `useRef` and `useEffect`.

### ✅ 5. Save Todos to localStorage

Use `useEffect`.

### ✅ 6. Use Light/Dark Theme

Use `useContext`.

### ✅ 7. Reuse Handlers

Use `useCallback` to avoid recreating them.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure (Suggested)

```
/src
  ├── App.tsx
  ├── components/
  │    ├── TodoInput.tsx
  │    ├── TodoList.tsx
  ├── context/
  │    └── ThemeContext.tsx
```

---

## 🔥 Bonus: Extend It Later

Once you've built it:

- Add filtering (All, Completed, Active)
- Use `useLayoutEffect` to auto-scroll
- Add `useRef` to animate items in/out
- Add a custom hook like `useTodos()`

---

Would you like me to give you the full code scaffold for this with `useReducer`, `useContext`, and all hooks plugged in?

Great question! Here's a **clear breakdown** of what you should learn in both **Redux** and **Node.js + Express**, so you can focus on what actually matters in real-world projects.

---

## 🔴 **Redux (with Redux Toolkit)**

Redux helps manage **global state** in large React apps. Here’s what to focus on:

### ✅ Core Concepts

1. **Store** – Single source of truth (where all app state lives)
2. **Actions** – Objects that describe what happened
3. **Reducers** – Functions that change the state based on actions
4. **Dispatch** – Method to send actions to reducers

### ✅ Redux Toolkit (RTK)

RTK simplifies Redux. Focus on:

- `configureStore`
- `createSlice` (combines action + reducer)
- `createAsyncThunk` (for async logic like API calls)

### ✅ Middleware

- Learn how Redux handles **async** calls with middleware like `redux-thunk`
- Logging and dev tools middleware

### ✅ React Integration

- `useSelector` – Get data from the store
- `useDispatch` – Send actions
- `Provider` – Wraps your app to provide store access

---

## 🟢 **Node.js + Express**

Node.js lets you build the **backend**, and Express is the most popular framework for it.

### ✅ Node.js Concepts

1. **Modules** – Built-in (fs, http) and custom modules
2. **Event Loop & Asynchronous Programming** – Understand callbacks, promises, async/await
3. **Environment Variables** – Using `.env` with `dotenv`

### ✅ Express.js Concepts

1. **Routing** – GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
2. **Middleware** – Request logging, validation, auth, etc.
3. **Error Handling** – Custom error middleware
4. **CORS** – Enabling communication with frontend
5. **Serving Static Files** – Serve frontend from Express
6. **Controllers & Services Structure** – Clean architecture

### ✅ Extra Must-Learn Topics

1. **RESTful API Design** – Build a complete CRUD API
2. **Database Integration** (MongoDB with Mongoose or PostgreSQL with Prisma)
3. **Authentication** – JWT or session-based auth
4. **API Validation** – Using `Joi` or `Zod`
5. **File Uploads**, **Email sending**, etc. (bonus)

---

Great choice, Sanjana! Since you’ve learned React and are now diving into **Node.js**, here’s a recommended **learning path** to become a **strong fullstack developer**:

---

### 🔧 Backend (Node.js + Express)

- ✅ **Node.js fundamentals** (event loop, modules, `fs`, `http`)
- ✅ **Express.js** (routing, middleware, error handling)
- ✅ **CORS, dotenv, nodemon**, `ts-node-dev` for dev setup
- ✅ **REST API development** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- ✅ **Request validation** (using `express-validator` or `zod`)
- ✅ **Authentication & Authorization** (JWT, bcrypt)
- ✅ **Environment variables** & secure config
- ✅ **File uploads** (Multer)
- ✅ **Error handling middleware**

---

### 🗄️ Databases

- 🔸 **MongoDB** (with Mongoose)
- 🔸 OR **PostgreSQL** (with Prisma or Sequelize)
- Learn CRUD operations, schema design, indexing
- Understand **relationships** (one-to-many, many-to-many)

---

### 📦 Project Structure & Advanced Topics

- Scalable **folder structure**
- MVC or service-based architecture
- Async/await error handling
- Logging (e.g., Winston)
- Unit & integration testing (Jest + Supertest)
- Docker basics (optional but good)

---

### 📡 Fullstack Integration

- Connecting your **React frontend to your Node.js backend**
- Use `axios` or `fetch` for API calls
- Build a complete **project** like:

  - Blog platform
  - E-commerce dashboard
  - Task manager (with auth and role-based access)

---

### Optional but Powerful:

- Redis (for caching or sessions)
- WebSockets (for real-time apps like chat)
- GraphQL (alternative to REST)

Got it — since AWS AI certs don’t interest you, and you’re **already familiar with React**, let’s build a **custom 2-month roadmap** to get you **industry-ready as a Full Stack Developer with AI capabilities**.

We’ll focus on **hands-on building**, **practical skills**, and **projects** that hiring managers love.
