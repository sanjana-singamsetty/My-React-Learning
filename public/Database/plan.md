Perfect — here’s an updated **1.5-Month (6-Week)** learning plan to get you **industry-ready** with **System Design** after React, especially if you're moving into a **full-stack developer role**. This plan covers:

- High-Level Design (HLD)
- Low-Level Design (LLD)
- Real-world systems
- Backend concepts
- Bonus AI integration awareness

## 📆 **6-Week Industry-Ready System Design Plan (Post-React)**

---

### ⚙️ **Week 1: Backend Fundamentals + APIs**

**Goal:** Get backend-ready to support full-stack development.

**Day 1–2:** Node.js & Express Basics — Build a simple REST API  
**Day 3:** CRUD with MongoDB/PostgreSQL — Connect DB to Express  
**Day 4:** Middleware, Routes, Controllers — Refactor your codebase  
**Day 5:** API Testing with Postman/Thunder — Write test cases and hit endpoints  
**Day 6:** Deploy with Render/Glitch/Heroku — Get your first backend live  
**Day 7:** Build Mini Project — Blog API / Todo API with full CRUD

---

### 🏗️ **Week 2: High-Level System Design (HLD)**

**Goal:** Understand the big-picture view of system architecture.

**Day 8:** What is System Design? Monolith vs Microservices — Visual walkthrough  
**Day 9:** Scalability, Latency, Availability — Read articles + YouTube visuals  
**Day 10:** Load Balancers & Networking — Learn about NGINX, DNS basics  
**Day 11:** Databases (SQL vs NoSQL) — Practice designing schemas  
**Day 12:** Caching (Redis, Memcached) — Understand eviction policies (LRU, LFU)  
**Day 13:** CAP Theorem, Consistency Models — Strong vs eventual consistency  
**Day 14:** Design YouTube / Twitter HLD — Use [draw.io](https://draw.io) or Excalidraw

---

### 🔧 **Week 3: Low-Level Design (LLD) Essentials**

**Goal:** Learn to design classes, APIs, and data flows.

**Day 15:** OOPS Concepts — Practice with TS/Java/JS  
**Day 16:** UML Diagrams (Class, Sequence) — Use Excalidraw / Mermaid  
**Day 17:** Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton, Strategy) — 1 pattern/day with code  
**Day 18:** Class Design Problems — Elevator System, Library System  
**Day 19:** Concurrency, Locks, Thread Safety — JS async flow + backend implications  
**Day 20:** Versioning & API Best Practices — REST, status codes, error handling  
**Day 21:** Design Instagram Backend (LLD) — Focus on modules & API routes

---

### 🛠️ **Week 4: End-to-End Project + Tradeoffs**

**Goal:** Combine HLD and LLD in a practical full-stack system.

**Day 22–23:** Tradeoffs: CAP, SQL vs NoSQL, Monolith vs Micro — Evaluate tradeoffs in design  
**Day 24:** HLD + LLD for a Scalable Todo / Notes App — End-to-end architecture sketch  
**Day 25:** Real-World Case: Netflix or WhatsApp — Architecture breakdown  
**Day 26:** Logging & Monitoring — Learn tools like LogRocket, Prometheus  
**Day 27:** Security (JWT, OAuth, HTTPS) — Secure your APIs  
**Day 28:** Project Deployment — Host full-stack app on Vercel + Render

---

### 🤖 **Week 5–6 (Bonus): AI Awareness & Resume-Ready Skills**

**Goal:** Add modern AI-ready and job-winning touch.

**Day 29:** System Design for AI-enabled Apps — Think about chat, personalization, analytics  
**Day 30:** Calling AI APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, AWS Bedrock) — Build a React app that uses AI APIs  
**Day 31:** Build: Smart Todo App (AI task suggestions) — Use OpenAI or fine-tuned GPT for ideas  
**Day 32:** Revisit: Message Queues (Kafka, BullMQ) — Async jobs demo  
**Day 33:** Resume + GitHub + Portfolio Updates — Document your projects cleanly  
**Day 34–36:** Mock Interviews + System Design Drills — Use Pramp, friends, or YouTube guides

---

## 🧠 Final Outcome:

- ✅ Strong in frontend (React)
- ✅ Built and deployed backend
- ✅ Can design real-world systems (Netflix, WhatsApp)
- ✅ Hands-on with HLD + LLD
- ✅ Aware of AI integration
- ✅ Resume + GitHub ready for interviews
