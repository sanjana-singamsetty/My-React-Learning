A common task for a web server can be to open a file on the server and return the content to the client.

Here is how PHP or ASP handles a file request:

Sends the task to the computer's file system.
Waits while the file system opens and reads the file.
Returns the content to the client.
Ready to handle the next request.
Here is how Node.js handles a file request:

Sends the task to the computer's file system.
Ready to handle the next request.
When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.

Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous programming, which is very memory efficient.
Components of the Node.js Architecture

- Requests: Depending on the actions that a user needs to perform, the requests to the server can be either blocking (complex) or non-blocking (simple).
- Node.js Server: The Node.js server accepts user requests, processes them, and returns results to the users.
- Event Queue: The main use of Event Queue is to store the incoming client requests and pass them sequentially to the Event Loop.
- Thread Pool: The Thread pool in a Node.js server contains the threads that are available for performing operations required to process requests.
- Event Loop: Event Loop receives requests from the Event Queue and sends out the responses to the clients.
  External Resources: In order to handle blocking client requests, external resources are used. They can be of any type ( computation, storage, etc).

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Node.js

It uses Google Chromeâ€™s V8 engine to run JavaScript on the server.

It uses a single-threaded event loop and non-blocking I/O operations.

Instead of creating a new thread for every request (like older systems), Node handles requests asynchronously.

### âœ… What it is:

Node.js is a **runtime environment** that allows you to run **JavaScript on the server** (outside the browser).

### âœ… Why we need it:

- Build **fast and scalable backend services**.
- Use **JavaScript everywhere** (frontend + backend).
- Handle **file operations, databases, APIs**, and real-time applications.
- To create webservers
  -js can talk to native machines because of c++

### âœ… Example:

```js
const http = require("http");

http
  .createServer((req, res) => {
    res.end("Hello from Node.js!");
  })
  .listen(3000);
```

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Express.js

### âœ… What it is:

Express.js is a **backend web framework** built on top of Node.js. It makes it easier to **create APIs, handle routes, middleware**, and manage requests.

### âœ… Why we need it:

- Simplifies complex server code in Node.js.
- Makes it easy to build **REST APIs**.
- Enables features like **authentication, middleware, routing**, etc.

### âœ… Example:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => res.send("Hello from Express!"));

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running on port 3000"));
```

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Next.js

### âœ… What it is:

Next.js is a **React framework** used for building **full-stack web applications**. It supports **server-side rendering (SSR)**, **static site generation (SSG)**, and **API routes**.

### âœ… Why we need it:

- Build **SEO-friendly** React apps.
- Create both **frontend and backend (API routes)** in one project.
- Out-of-the-box support for **routing, SSR, SSG, image optimization**, etc.

### âœ… Example:

A file at `pages/index.tsx` will automatically become your homepage.
A file at `pages/api/hello.ts` can handle an API request.

## ðŸ§  In Summary

- Use **Node.js** if you want to run JavaScript on the server.
- Use **Express.js (with Node.js)** if you want to build RESTful APIs easily.
- Use **Next.js** if you want to build full-stack React apps with SSR/API routes.
