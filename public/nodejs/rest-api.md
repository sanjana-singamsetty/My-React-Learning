### 🌐 What is a REST API?

**REST API** stands for **Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface**. It's a way for two computer systems to **communicate over the internet** using standard **HTTP methods** like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

- server and client architecture

### 🔧 Key Concepts of REST API:

- **Client**: The user or frontend app making the request (e.g., browser or mobile app)
- **Server**: The backend that provides the data or services
- **Resource**: Any object or data (like user, product, post) exposed via the API
- **Endpoint**: The specific URL used to access a resource (e.g., `/users`, `/posts/1`)
- **HTTP Methods**: Actions that can be performed on resources

---

### 📥 Common HTTP Methods in REST:

- **GET**: Read or fetch data (e.g., get all users or a specific user)
- **POST**: Create new data (e.g., create a new user)
- **PUT**: Update entire data (replace) (e.g., update all details of a user)
- **PATCH**: Update part of the data (e.g., update one field of a user)
- **DELETE**: Delete data (e.g., delete a user)

---

### 📌 Example:

Imagine a REST API for a Book Store:

- **Get all books**: `GET /books` – Fetches list of books
- **Get one book**: `GET /books/1` – Fetches book with ID 1
- **Add a new book**: `POST /books` – Adds a new book
- **Update a book's details**: `PUT /books/1` – Replaces book with ID 1
- **Delete a book**: `DELETE /books/1` – Deletes book with ID 1

---

### ✅ Why Use REST APIs?

- Platform-independent (works on web, mobile, etc.)
- Uses standard HTTP methods
- Easy to understand and implement
- Widely supported

Would you like to see how to **build a REST API using Express.js**?

Great question! Here's a clear breakdown of the **difference between an API and a REST API**:

---

### 🔹 **API (Application Programming Interface)**

- **Definition:**
  An **API** is a **set of rules** that allows one piece of software to interact with another.
  Think of it as a **bridge** between different software systems.

- **Purpose:**
  Enables communication between software systems (backend ↔ frontend, app ↔ server, etc.).

- **Types of APIs:**

  - REST API
  - SOAP API
  - GraphQL API
  - gRPC
  - WebSockets, etc.

- **Example:**
  A library API lets you call functions to sort a list or save a file.

---

### 🔹 **REST API (Representational State Transfer API)**

- **Definition:**
  A **REST API** is a specific type of API that follows the principles of **REST architecture**, using **HTTP** to communicate.

- **Purpose:**
  Allows web-based systems to exchange data over the internet in a **stateless**, **structured**, and **resource-oriented** way.

- **Uses HTTP methods:** GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

- **Returns data in formats like:** JSON, XML.

- **Example:**
  A REST API for a blog might let you:
  - `GET /posts` – fetch all blog posts
  - `POST /posts` – create a new blog post

---

### 🔸 Summary Points:

- **Definition**:
  - API: Interface for communication between apps
  - REST API: A type of API that uses REST principles
- **Protocol**:
  - API: Can use HTTP, FTP, libraries, etc.
  - REST API: Uses **HTTP** protocol
- **Architecture**:
  - API: Any style (RPC, GraphQL, SOAP, etc.)
  - REST API: Strictly follows **REST architecture**
- **Data Format**:
  - API: Any format (binary, JSON, XML, etc.)
  - REST API: Usually **JSON or XML**
- **Use Case**:
  - API: Broad – includes desktop, libraries, OS
  - REST API: Mostly used for **web services**

---

### ✅ In short:

> 🔸 **All REST APIs are APIs**, but **not all APIs are REST APIs.**

The **REST principles** (also called REST constraints) are the core rules that define what makes an API truly "RESTful". REST was introduced by **Roy Fielding** in his PhD dissertation and follows 6 main architectural principles:

---

### ✅ 1. **Client-Server Architecture**

- **Definition:** The client and server are separate.
- **Goal:** Separation of concerns – the client handles the **UI**, the server handles **data and logic**.
- **Example:** A mobile app (client) sends a request to an API server to fetch user details.

---

### ✅ 2. **Statelessness**

- **Definition:** Every request from the client must contain **all the information** the server needs.
- **Goal:** The server does **not store any session or context** between requests.
- **Example:** If you're logged in, your token (like a JWT) must be sent with **every request**.

---

### ✅ 3. **Cacheability**

- **Definition:** Responses must define whether they are cacheable or not.
- **Goal:** Improve performance by **reusing responses**.
- **Example:** A product listing page may be cached for 10 minutes to reduce server load.

---

### ✅ 4. **Uniform Interface**

- **Definition:** A consistent and standardized way of interacting with resources.
- **Goal:** Simplicity and decoupling.
- **Key Elements:**

  - Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Use URIs to identify resources (e.g., `/users/123`)
  - Use standard status codes (e.g., 200, 404, 500)
  - Self-descriptive messages (body, headers should provide full info)

---

### ✅ 5. **Layered System**

- **Definition:** A REST API can have multiple layers (e.g., proxy, load balancer, server) between client and data.
- **Goal:** Improve scalability and security.
- **Example:** A load balancer sits between the client and the backend server to distribute traffic.

---

### ✅ 6. **Code on Demand (Optional)**

- **Definition:** Servers can return code that the client can execute.
- **Goal:** Extend client functionality on the fly.
- **Example:** A server returns JavaScript to be run by the browser.

---

### 🎯 Summary Table:

**REST Principles Summary:**

1. **Client-Server:** Separates client UI from server logic.
2. **Stateless:** No session; each request is independent.
3. **Cacheable:** Responses can be cached to improve performance.
4. **Uniform Interface:** Standard and consistent method to access resources.
5. **Layered System:** Use of layers for scalability and security.
6. **Code on Demand:** Send executable code from server (optional).
