# HTML Overview

**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. It forms the backbone of the World Wide Web, enabling the creation and formatting of documents that can be viewed in web browsers.

HTML documents are made up of a series of elements, enclosed within angle brackets called **tags**.

- `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`: Contains meta information about the HTML page.
- `<title>`: Specifies the title of the HTML page displayed in the browser.
- `<body>`: Contains all visible content of the document.
- `<h1>`: Defines a large heading.
- `<p>`: Defines a paragraph.

## Key Points

### 1. Websites are Built from Documents ✅

When you visit a website, you're actually requesting a document (usually an `.html` file).  
The browser downloads and renders that document so you can see a webpage.

**Example:**

- You open `https://example.com`
- The browser fetches `index.html`
- It reads the HTML and displays content like text, images, and buttons

### 2. Structured Content ✅

Documents (especially HTML) provide structure and semantics to the content.
