For a **fullstack project**, testing in your **CI/CD pipeline** should cover multiple layers to ensure **frontend + backend + integration** all work together. Here’s a breakdown of the **types of tests** and what to include in the pipeline:

---

## 🧪 **1. Unit Tests (Frontend & Backend)**

### ✅ Purpose:

- Test **individual functions or components in isolation**

### 🛠 Frontend:

- Components render correctly
- User interactions (clicks, inputs, state changes)
- Utility functions or hooks

🧪 Tools: `Jest`, `React Testing Library`

### 🛠 Backend:

- Business logic (functions, services)
- Utility/helper functions
- Input validation logic

🧪 Tools: `Jest`, `Mocha`, `Chai`, `Supertest` (for API logic)

---

## 🔄 **2. Integration Tests**

### ✅ Purpose:

- Test how **modules or components work together**
- Includes DB, API, and logic flow

### Examples:

- API endpoint calling DB and returning correct data
- Frontend form that submits to backend and handles response

🧪 Tools:

- Backend: `Supertest` + `Jest` or `Mocha`
- Frontend: `React Testing Library` (for testing page interactions)
- Mocks: use in-memory DB (e.g., `mongodb-memory-server`, `sqlite`, etc.)

---

## 🌐 **3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests**

### ✅ Purpose:

- Simulate real user interactions **across the full system**

### Examples:

- User signs up → receives token → logs in → sees dashboard
- User fills form → data saved in DB → shows success message

🧪 Tools: `Cypress`, `Playwright`, `Selenium`

---

## 🧰 **4. API Contract Tests**

### ✅ Purpose:

- Ensure APIs follow expected contracts (input/output shapes)

### Tools:

- `jest` or `supertest` (backend)
- `swagger` validation
- `pact` (for consumer-driven contract testing)

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ **5. Static Analysis & Linting**

### ✅ Purpose:

- Catch syntax errors, formatting issues, and enforce code quality

### Tools:

- ESLint / Prettier (frontend)
- Lint rules for backend (e.g., `eslint`, `flake8` for Python)

---

## 🧯 **6. Security Tests (Optional but Recommended)**

### ✅ Purpose:

- Find vulnerabilities early

### Tools:

- `npm audit`
- `Snyk`, `OWASP ZAP`
- Static code analyzers

---

## 🚥 **7. CI/CD Pipeline Setup (What to Automate)**

- **Pre-commit (optional):** Run linting, formatting, and unit tests before code is pushed.
- **Build:** Compile both frontend and backend code.
- **Test:** Execute unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests.
- **Coverage:** Check that code coverage meets the minimum threshold (e.g., 80%).
- **Lint:** Enforce code style and formatting rules.
- **Deploy (if tests pass):** Deploy to staging or production environments.
- **Rollback/fail-fast:** Stop the pipeline and fail early if any step fails.

## 🧪 Example Pipeline Workflow

```yaml
# GitHub Actions (example)
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - checkout
      - setup Node / backend env
      - install deps
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run test # unit + integration
      - run: npm run e2e # cypress / playwright
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm run deploy # if using preview deploys
```

## ✅ Summary: What Tests You Need in a Fullstack Project Pipeline

- **Unit Tests (Frontend & Backend)**

  - Required for both frontend and backend code
  - Tools: Jest, React Testing Library (RTL), Mocha

- **Integration Tests**

  - Required to verify modules/components work together
  - Tools: Supertest, React Testing Library

- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**

  - Required to simulate real user flows across the system
  - Tools: Cypress, Playwright

- **Lint & Static Analysis**

  - Required to enforce code quality and catch errors early
  - Tools: ESLint, Prettier

- **Contract Tests**

  - Optional, ensures API contracts are followed
  - Tools: Pact, Swagger

- **Security Scans**
  - Optional, helps find vulnerabilities
  - Tools: Snyk, npm audit

Would you like a **template GitHub Actions YAML file** or a **test coverage strategy** for your own project stack (React + Express/Mongo for example)?
