Great question! Let's break down the three key concepts in web security: **authentication**, **authorization**, and **cookies** — in a simple and beginner-friendly way, with examples.

---

## 🔐 1. **Authentication**

> “**Who are you?**”

### ✅ Definition:

**Authentication** is the process of verifying **a user’s identity** — usually using a **username and password**, OTP, biometrics, etc.

### 🧠 Example:

When you **log in to Instagram** using your email and password — Instagram checks whether it’s really you.

### 🛠️ Common Methods:

- Username + Password
- OTP via email/SMS
- Google/Facebook Login (OAuth)
- Fingerprint or Face ID

---

## ✅ 2. **Authorization**

> “**What are you allowed to do?**”

### ✅ Definition:

**Authorization** determines **what actions** or **resources** a logged-in user is allowed to access.

### 🧠 Example:

On Instagram:

- Regular user can post, like, follow.
- Admin can also delete accounts.

> Both are **authenticated**, but their **permissions differ**.

### 🔑 Works **after authentication**

## 🍪 3. **Cookies**

> “A small piece of data the browser stores for the website.”

### ✅ Definition:

A **cookie** is a **key-value pair** stored in your **browser**, used to remember info across pages and sessions.

### 🧠 Example:

After you log in, the server may store:

```http
Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly
```

Your browser will send this on every future request:

```http
Cookie: sessionId=abc123
```

> It helps the server remember that **you are logged in** — this is how sessions work in stateful auth.

## 🔄 Putting It All Together (Flow Example)

1. **Authentication**

   - User logs in (email + password).
   - Server verifies → creates a session → sets a cookie like:

     ```js
     sessionId = abc123;
     ```

2. **Cookies**

   - Browser stores the cookie and sends it with every request.

3. **Authorization**

   - Server checks the session from the cookie.
   - Decides what user is allowed to do (e.g., view profile, admin actions).

---

## 🧩 Summary Table

- **Authentication**: Verifying identity

  - Example: Logging in with email/password

- **Authorization**: Giving permissions based on identity

  - Example: Only admins can delete users

- **Cookies**: Browser storage of small data
  - Example: `sessionId=abc123`

Let me know if you'd like visuals, code examples (Node.js, Django, React), or help setting up secure cookies (like `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`).
