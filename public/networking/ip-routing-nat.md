Here’s a clear breakdown of **IP Routing** and **NAT (Network Address Translation)**—two core networking concepts:

---

## 📡 IP Routing

**IP Routing** is the process of forwarding data packets between networks based on their destination IP addresses.

### 🔧 How It Works:

1. Each device (computer/router) has an **IP address**.
2. When Device A wants to talk to Device B (maybe on another network), the **router**:

- Looks at the **destination IP** in the packet
- Checks its **routing table**
- Forwards the packet to the correct **next hop/router**
- Eventually, it reaches the **destination network**.

### 📘 Key Terms:

- **Routing Table**: A list of rules that tells the router where to forward data.
- **Default Gateway**: The router a device sends data to when the destination isn't on the local network.
- **Static Routing**: Manually configured routes (used in simple setups).
- **Dynamic Routing**: Uses routing protocols (like OSPF, BGP) to update routes automatically in real-time.

## 🌐 NAT (Network Address Translation)

**NAT** is a method used by routers to **translate private IP addresses** (used inside local networks) to a **single public IP address** (used on the internet) — and vice versa.

### 🔧 Why NAT is Needed:

- IPv4 has a limited number of public IP addresses.
- NAT allows **multiple devices to share one public IP**.

### 📘 Types of NAT:

- **SNAT (Source NAT)**: Rewrites the source IP address of outgoing packets.
- **DNAT (Destination NAT)**: Changes the destination IP (used in port forwarding).
- **PAT (Port Address Translation)** aka **NAT Overload**: Many devices share one public IP, differentiated by port numbers.

### 🔁 Example:

- Your laptop has IP `192.168.1.10`
- It accesses a website on the internet
- Router changes `192.168.1.10` → `203.0.113.2` (your public IP)
- The response comes back to `203.0.113.2`, and the router knows to send it back to your laptop

## 🧩 Summary Points

**IP Routing:**

- Purpose: Forwards packets across networks.
- Used By: Routers.
- Protocol Layer: Network Layer (Layer 3).
- Affects IP Address?: No (just forwards).
- Use Case: Moving data between networks.

**NAT:**

- Purpose: Translates private ↔ public IP addresses.
- Used By: Routers/firewalls.
- Protocol Layer: Network/Transport Layer (Layer 3/4).
- Affects IP Address?: Yes (rewrites source/destination IP).
- Use Case: Allowing private devices to access the internet.

## 🌐 What is an IP Address?

An **IP address** (Internet Protocol address) is a unique number assigned to a device on a network so it can communicate with other devices.

---

## 🔒 Private IP Address

**Private IPs** are used **within local networks** (like your home, school, or office).

- Not routable on the public internet.
- Used for internal communication only.
- Devices like your phone, laptop, or printer get private IPs from your Wi-Fi router.

### ✅ Common Private IP Ranges (IPv4):

- `10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255` (CIDR: `10.0.0.0/8`, Example: `10.0.1.15`)
- `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255` (CIDR: `172.16.0.0/12`, Example: `172.16.5.5`)
- `192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255` (CIDR: `192.168.0.0/16`, Example: `192.168.1.1`)

> 🧠 **Used in:** LANs (Local Area Networks), behind a router or NAT.

---

## 🌍 Public IP Address

**Public IPs** are used **on the internet**. They are **globally unique** and assigned by ISPs (Internet Service Providers).

- Can be accessed from anywhere on the internet.
- Routers or servers use public IPs to communicate over the web.

### ✅ Example Public IPs:

- `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS)
- `132.45.11.79` (example ISP-assigned IP)

> 🧠 Your home router usually has **one public IP**, which is shared with multiple devices using **NAT**.

---

## 🔁 Example Scenario

Let’s say you have 3 devices at home:

- Laptop: `192.168.0.10` (Private)
- Phone: `192.168.0.11` (Private)
- Router: `192.168.0.1` (private side), `49.206.115.23` (public side, Both)

- All devices share **the same public IP** (`49.206.115.23`) to access the internet.
- Internally, they use **private IPs** to talk to each other.

---

## 🧩 Summary Points

**Private IP:**

- Visibility: Local network only.
- Uniqueness: Can be repeated across networks.
- Assigned By: Router/DHCP.
- Routable on Internet: No.
- Example: `192.168.1.5`.

**Public IP:**

- Visibility: Visible on the internet.
- Uniqueness: Must be globally unique.
- Assigned By: ISP (Internet Service Provider).
- Routable on Internet: Yes.
- Example: `142.250.195.14`.
